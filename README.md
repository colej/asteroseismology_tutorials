# asteroseismology_tutorials
This repository contains collection of tutorials on how to extract asteroseismic 
signal from single and binary stars. I will probably update this occasionally to 
include new examples as I come up with them or am prompted to because I can't say
no to things.

Many of these notebooks were originally made for the 2022 Erasmus+ workshop on 
binary stars and asteroseismology in La Palma, Spain. The original notebooks can
be found here: https://github.com/IACERASMUS/ERASMUS2022/tree/gh-pages/notebooks/Cole

## Pre-requisites
In these notebooks, I will use the pythia time-series analysis package that I developed.
The package comes with an environment yml file and installation instructions that 
should get you up and running! 
You can find the pythia package here: https://github.com/colej/pythia
